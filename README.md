Multivariate Exploratory Analysis using Hierarchical Clustering and PCA

Unsupervised Machine Learning using python to classify universities into 5 clusters.

Further using PCA's dimensionality reduction to reduce our dimensions to two, for easier data visualisation.

Using parallel coordinate plots and box plots to help explain the clusters after applying PCA.
